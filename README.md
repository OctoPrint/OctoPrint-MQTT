# OctoPrint MQTT Plugin

This is an OctoPrint Plugin that adds support for [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) to OctoPrint.

### Events

Out of the box OctoPrint will send all [events](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/devel/events/index.html#available-events)
including their payloads to the topic `octoPrint/event/<event>`, where `<event>` will be the name of the event. The message
payload will be a JSON representation of the event's payload, with an additional property `_event` containing the name
of the event and a property `_timestamp` containing the unix timestamp of when the message was created.

Examples:

| Topic                        | Message                                                          |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| octoPrint/event/ClientOpened | `{"_timestamp": 1517190629, "_event": "ClientOpened", "remoteAddress": "127.0.0.1"}`       |
| octoPrint/event/Connected    | `{"_timestamp": 1517190629, "_event": "Connected", "baudrate": 250000, "port": "VIRTUAL"}` |
| octoPrint/event/PrintStarted | `{"_timestamp": 1517190629, "_event": "PrintStarted", "origin": "local", "file":"/home/pi/.octoprint/uploads/case_bp_3.6.v1.0.gco", "filename": "case_bp_3.6.v1.0.gco"}` |

### Print and slicing progress

The print progress and the slicing progress will also be send to the topic `octoPrint/progress/printing` and
`octoPrint/progress/slicing` respectively. The payload will contain the `progress` as an integer between 0 and 100.
Print progress will also contain information about the currently printed file (storage `location` and `path` on storage),
slicing progress will contain information about the currently sliced file (storage `source_location` and `destination_location`,
`source_path` and `destination_path` on storage, used `slicer`). The payload will also contain a property `_timestamp`
containing the unix timestamp of when the message was created. The published progress messages will be marked as
retained.

Examples:

| Topic                        | Message                                                          |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| octoPrint/progress/printing  | `{"_timestamp": 1517190629, "progress": 23, "location": "local", "path": "test.gco"}`      |
| octoPrint/progress/slicing   | `{"_timestamp": 1517190629, "progress": 42, "source_location": "local", "source_path": "test.stl", "destination_location": "local", "destination_path": "test.gcode", "slicer": "cura"}` |

### Temperatures

The plugin also publishes the temperatures of the tools and the bed to `octoPrint/temperature/<tool>` where `<tool>` will either
be 'bed' or 'toolX' (X is the number of the tool). The payload will contain the `actual` and the `target` temperature as floating point value plus the current `time` as unix timestamp in seconds.
New messages will not be published constantly, but only when a value changes. The payload will also contain a property `_timestamp`
containing the unix timestamp of when the message was created. The published messages will be marked as retained.

Examples:

| Topic                        | Message                                                          |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| octoPrint/temperature/tool0  | `{"_timestamp": 1517190629, "actual": 65.3, "target": 210.0}`                              |
| octoPrint/temperature/bed    | `{"_timestamp": 1517190629, "actual": 42.1, "target": 65.0}`                               |

### Additional Metadata

You can also define keys from the print file's additional metadata to publish on print start. This is especially useful together with plugins like [OctoPrint-SlicerSettingsParser](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/SlicerSettingsParser/).
You can enter a comma separted list of keys in the plugin settings. The plugin will then publish the values of these keys to the topic `octoprint/metadata/<key>`.
Collections (dictionaries, lists) will be json encoded. To get specific values from a dictionary, you can use a dot notation (e.g. `dict.key.subkey`).

Examples:

| Topic                                            | Message                                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| octoprint/metadata/layer_height                  | `0.2`                                                                                |
| octoprint/metadata/slicer_settings               | `{"material_type": "PLA", "layer_height": "0.2", "filament_amount": "[48.92]", ...}` |
| octoprint/metadata/slicer_settings.material_type | `PLA`                                                                                |


### Connection status / Last will

Additionally the plugin will publish `connected` to `octoPrint/mqtt` on connection and instruct the MQTT broker to publish
`disconnected` there if the connection gets closed. The published messages will be marked as retained.

Examples:

| Topic                        | Message              |
|------------------------------|----------------------|
| octoPrint/mqtt               | `connected`          |

You are able to deactivate topics and the status/last will in the settings. This allows you to e.g. only send temperature messages when you don't
need event or progress messages.

### Printer data

If the Printer Data option is set, then extended printer information as outlined in the
[Common data model](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/api/datamodel.html) will be included in a `printer_data` attribute.
Useful to get information such as print time remaining.

Example:

| Topic                        | Message              |
|------------------------------|----------------------|
| octoPrint/progress/printing  | `{"progress": 0, "_timestamp": 1525654824, "location": "local", "path": "Stringing_Test.gco", "printer_data": {"progress": {"completion": 0.008520926537352922, "printTimeLeftOrigin": "average", "printTime": 0, "printTimeLeft": 273, "filepos": 139}, "state": {"text": "Printing", "flags": {"cancelling": false, "paused": false, "operational": true, "pausing": false, "printing": true, "sdReady": true, "error": false, "ready": false, "closedOrError": false}}, "currentZ": null, "job": {"file": {"origin": "local", "name": "Stringing_Test.gco", "date": 1525586467, "path": "Stringing_Test.gco", "display": "Stringing_Test.gco", "size": 1631278}, "estimatedPrintTime": 1242.9603101308749, "averagePrintTime": 273.6990565955639, "filament": {"tool0": {"volume": 0.0, "length": 363.0717599999999}}, "lastPrintTime": 269.25606203079224}, "offsets": {}}}` |

The plugin also offers several helpers that allow other plugins to both publish as well as subscribe to
MQTT topics, see below for details and a usage example.

## Installation

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager) using this URL:

    https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-MQTT/archive/master.zip

## Configuration

The plugin offers a settings dialog that allows you to configure all relevant settings. If you want to configure things
manually by editing `config.yaml`, this is the structure you'd find therein:

``` yaml
plugins:
    mqtt:
        broker:
            # the broker's url, mandatory, if not configured the plugin will do nothing
            url: 127.0.0.1

            # the broker's port
            #port: 1883

            # the username to use to connect with the broker, if not set no user
            # credentials will be sent
            #username: unset

            # the password to use to connect with the broker, only used if a
            # username is supplied too
            #password: unset

            # the keepalive value for the broker connection
            #keepalive: 60

            # tls settings
            #tls:
                # path to the server's certificate file
                #ca_certs: unset

                # paths to the PEM encoded client certificate and private keys
                # respectively, must not be password protected, only necessary
                # if broker requires client certificate authentication
                #certfile: unset
                #keyfile: unset

                # a string specifying which encryption ciphers are allowable for this connection
                #ciphers: unset

            # configure verification of the server hostname in the server certificate.
            #tls_insecure: false

            # configure protocol version to use, valid values: MQTTv31 and MQTTv311
            #protocol: MQTTv31

            # should mqtt connection status / last will be retained?
            #lwRetain: true

        publish:
            # base topic under which to publish OctoPrint's messages
            #baseTopic: octoPrint/

            # include extended printer data in a printer_data attribute, this will
            # greatly increase the size of each message
            # printerData: false

            # topic for events, appended to the base topic, '{event}' will
            # be substituted with the event name
            #eventTopic: event/{event}

            # should events be published?
            #eventActive: true

            # topic for print and slicer progress, appended to the base topic,
            # '{progress}' will be substituted with either 'printing' or 'slicing'
            #progressTopic: progress/{progress}

            # should progress be published?
            #progressActive: true

            # topic for temperatures, appended to the base topic,
            # '{temp}' will be substituted with either 'toolX' (X is the number of the tool) or 'bed'
            #temperatureTopic: temperature/{temp}

            # should temperatures be published?
            #temperatureActive: true

            # topic for additional metadata, appended to the base topic,
            # '{key}' will be substituted with the key from the additional metadata
            #metadataTopic: metadata/{key}

            # should additional metadata be published?
            #metadataActive: false

            # keys from the additional metadata to publish, comma separated string
            #metadataKeys: "slicer_settings.material_type"

            # should mqtt connection status / last will be published?
            #lwActive: true

            # topic for connection status / last will
            #lwTopic: mqtt
```

## Helpers

### mqtt_publish(topic, payload, retained=False, qos=0, allow_queueing=False, raw_data=False)

Publishes `payload` to `topic`. If `retained` is set to `True`, message will be flagged to be retained by the
broker. The QOS setting can be overridden with the `qos` parameter.

`payload` may be a string in which case it will be sent as is. Otherwise a value conversion to JSON will be performed, unless you set `raw_data` to `True`.

If the MQTT plugin is currently not connected to the broker but `allow_queueing` is `True`, the message will be
stored internally and published upon connection to the broker.

Returns `True` if the message was accepted to be published by the MQTT plugin, `False` if the message could not
be accepted (e.g. due to the plugin being not connected to the broker and queueing not being allowed).

### mqtt_publish_with_timestamp(topic, payload, retained=False, qos=0, allow_queueing=False, timestamp=None)

Publishes `payload` to `topic` including a timestamp. `payload` *must* be a Python `dict` and will be extended by a
property `_timestamp` set to the provided `timestamp` or - if unset - the current timestamp.

If the `publish.printerData` option is set, then all of the data from `self._printer.get_current_data()` will be
included as a `printer_data` attribute in the payload. Useful to get things such as time remaining.

Everything else behaves as `mqtt_publish` (which is also used internally).

### mqtt_subscribe(topic, callback, args=None, kwargs=None)

Subscribes `callback` for messages published on `topic`. The MQTT plugin will call the `callback` for received
messages like this:

    callback(topic, payload, args..., retained=..., qos=..., kwargs...)

`topic` will be the exact topic the message was received for, payload the message's payload, `retained` whether the
message was retained by the broker and `qos` the message's QOS setting.

The callback should therefore at least accept `topic` and `payload` of the message as positional arguments and
`retain` and `qos` as keyword arguments. If additional positional arguments or keyword arguments where provided
during subscription, they will be provided as outlined above.

### mqtt_unsubscribe(callback, topic=None)

Unsubscribes the `callback`. If not `topic` is provided all subscriptions for the `callback` will be removed, otherwise
only those matching the `topic` exactly.

### Example

The following single file plugin demonstrates how to use the provided helpers. Place it as `mqtt_test.py` into your
`~/.octoprint/plugins` (or equivalent) folder.

```python
import octoprint.plugin

class MqttTestPlugin(octoprint.plugin.StartupPlugin):

	def __init__(self):
		self.mqtt_publish = lambda *args, **kwargs: None
		self.mqtt_subscribe = lambda *args, **kwargs: None
		self.mqtt_unsubscribe = lambda *args, **kwargs: None

	def on_after_startup(self):
		helpers = self._plugin_manager.get_helpers("mqtt", "mqtt_publish", "mqtt_subscribe", "mqtt_unsubscribe")
		if helpers:
			if "mqtt_publish" in helpers:
				self.mqtt_publish = helpers["mqtt_publish"]
			if "mqtt_subscribe" in helpers:
				self.mqtt_subscribe = helpers["mqtt_subscribe"]
			if "mqtt_unsubscribe" in helpers:
				self.mqtt_unsubscribe = helpers["mqtt_unsubscribe"]

		self.mqtt_publish("octoPrint/plugin/mqtt_test/pub", "test plugin startup")
		self.mqtt_subscribe("octoPrint/plugin/mqtt_test/sub", self._on_mqtt_subscription)

	def _on_mqtt_subscription(self, topic, message, retained=None, qos=None, *args, **kwargs):
		self._logger.info("Yay, received a message for {topic}: {message}".format(**locals()))
		self.mqtt_publish("octoPrint/plugin/mqtt_test/pub", "echo: " + message)


__plugin_implementations__ = [MqttTestPlugin()]
```
